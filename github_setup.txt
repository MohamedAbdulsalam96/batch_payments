generate a key into /home/ubuntu/.ssh/ folder creating a file

id_rsa
id_rsa.pub which is the public key


be sure to retain the passphrase for later

Go the the github site and User->Settings->SSH and GPG Keys to install the SSH public key


Next download and install gh via

 ubuntu@vps-f5da0f99:~/.ssh$ curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg && sudo chmod go+r /usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg && echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null && sudo apt update && sudo apt install gh -y


 all so you can run 

 gh auth login

This will allow you to cache the credentials

You then need to go to github and enter the one-time code.


Next you need to go to Settings->Developer Settings->Personal Access Tokens and then create an authorisation token for the GitHub CLI on that machine, with admin:public_key, gist, read:org and entire repo scope.

Be sure to copy this token to the buffer as you will soon need it.

When creating the gh auth login you will be prompted to paste it in.  Paste it in.

Now add a remote repo

git remote add origin git+ssh://git@github.com/fiedag/<repo>
e.g. git remote add origin git+ssh://git@github.com/fiedag/batch_payments

This should ask for the passphrase only once.
